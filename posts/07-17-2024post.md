# Continuing Strong: Week 2
Well, well, well... This past week has been a productive week. I've been trying to plan out my own cs curriculum and I am making good progress. First, a double of things that I've finished up this week...
- First and foremost, I completed my AWS certification. I am planning on getting the Solutions Architect certification and need to start studying for that course as well.
- I am almost done with [MIT 6.1810-OS Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html) and plan on reviewing the [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) code deeply as well as starting MIT's graduate course on security [MIT 6.5660-Security](https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2024/)! Additionally, I am continuing my work on distributed systems by continuing [MIT 6.5840-Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/).
- I added Shiny apps to my website! I would prefer a convenient, personal way to host these apps on a service other than Shiny server. However, I'm glad to have figured out how to display my Shiny apps on my website. I plan on hosting interesting applications on my website so this was great news!
- I additionally have been brushing up my theory. 
    - I have been speeding through [Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X). I am current on chapter 5 of the book and plan on going through some exercises once I reach chapter 7. I assume that going through exercises and reviewing chapter 1-7 will take 1-2 weeks. 
    - Additionally, I've been working through a graduate text on graph theory, [Graph Theory by JA Bondy and USR Murty](https://www.amazon.com/Graph-Theory-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1849966907). The textbook has "recommended" exercises to develop an understanding of the material. These exercises are sparse relative to the entire text, so my strategy is to only focus on these essential exercises and soak in as much information on the first read. Then, I can more closely tackle challenge problems on a second pass. 
    - I also have made progress on [The Joy of Cryptography by Mike Rosulek](https://joyofcryptography.com/), reading up to Chapter 6. My strategy has been the same as the books above. I plan on more closely doing exercises from Chapter 4 onwards. I will do this in hand with [Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X) when I decide to focus on exercises. 
- Additionally, I have read several papers: 
    - The first group of papers are the following [Resilient Overlay Networks by Anderson, Balakrishnan, Kaashoek, and Morris](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/ron-sosp2001.pdf), [DARPA Internet Protocols by Clark](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-clark.pdf), [Ethernet by Metcalfe and Boggs](https://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/EthernetPaper.pdf), and [Tor by Dingledine, Mathewson, and Syverson](https://svn-archive.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf). I have started a reading group with one of my friends and these were the papers that we decided to discuss.
    - Additionally, for MIT's 6.1810, I have read the following papers: [Journaling the Linux ext2fs Filesystem](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc521.081/docs/paper.aw.pdf), [Virtual Memory Primitives for User Programs](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/vmpup.pdf), and [The Performance of Micro-Kernel-Based Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/268998.266660). 
    - Of course, I didn't understand everything from these papers. However, I understood parts of these papers and believe that exposure to more challenging concepts can only help me! Hence, I will press forward. 

Additionally, I've been keeping my consistency with the gym and running. I've pushed my 1.5 mile pace to just under 8 minutes. I realize now that running 1.5 miles everyday was not the best move for my joints. I've been researching running form but regardless I will ease my way into running. As such, I've been taking rest days as I usually do with strength/weight training. On a side note, I want to get back into mixing music! I want to post some of my mixes on the website as well. It would be a great way to also learn how to implement streaming. Maybe by the next few weekly logs, my mixes will be posted.
