# Starting Fresh: Week 1

Hi. It probably makes sense to introduce myself, as this is my *first* post ([yippee](https://youtube.com/shorts/Qu7KFMn54Bk?si=znTyhUGYlGsGfBst))! I'm currently in my *fun*employment era and have been thinking about what I enjoy in life. For most of my life, you could say I was a dabbler. In middle school, I wanted to pursue esports; then in high school, it was music; then, I was all-in on constitutional law; then, economics (terrible, I know...); then, statistics and mathematics; and now computer science. You see, I have a problem (or a blessing, depending on the way you frame it). When I get into something, I **really** get into it. This (*quite frankly*) addict-like approach to my life is quite volatile and doesn't lend itself well to long-term consistency. As the famous adage goes...

"Success is futile in an insufficient system"
- \<insert\> motivational influencer

Through these logs (and other lifestyle habits), I want to set up the appropriate system for success. 

## What is Success?

Before moving on, I should define what **success** means to me. Fuck... I'm a 22 year old just trying to figure things out so I honestly don't know. As I would say, "I'm just living life bro." I'm sure an older me will have a better answer but for now I think success is achieved through honing your craft and using that expertise to collaborate with others and innovate. **This** is my ["there is no i in business"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROaj3bCpZEM&ab_channel=InternetHistorian), professional goal.

That said, I'm fucking 22. 

"Jonathan, you just graduated college and are *just* starting to study X or Y!? Isn't it too late? There are literal toddlers who have developed/created/did X, Y, Z? It's cooked!" 
- My crippling imposter syndrome + self-doubt

Yeah... Comparison fucking sucks. It's something that I have to work on. But comparing doesn't change shit. I may have missed the best time to plant a tree, but the second best time is now. Thus, here I am. 

## My Goals
**Cyclic Goals**
- Run 1.5 miles everyday in the morning (I'm a typical gym bro; my cardio fucking sucks)
- Workout 3 times a week
- Read 2-3 papers a week and comment on them (maybe even some replication)
- Practice Korean 15 minutes a day (thank you [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/))

**Short Term Goals**
- Find a goddamn job
- Finish this website
- Textbooks that I want to self-study/finish/review (there are a lot but these are just on my list)
    - [Bayesian Data Analysis by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/)
    - [Computer Architecture-A Quantitative Approach by John Hennessy and David Patterson](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Architecture-Quantitative-Approach-Kaufmann/dp/0128119055/ref=pd_lpo_sccl_1/142-9718449-3690637?pd_rd_w=WcuyK&content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_r=T45BBX6JHQ95B3ZSA428&pd_rd_wg=akLZP&pd_rd_r=2611a6b9-3525-466f-8552-6f5fe6acc060&pd_rd_i=0128119055&psc=1)
    - [Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X)
    - [Computational Complexity-A Modern Approach by Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/book.pdf)
    - [TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1-The Protocols by Kevin Fall and Richard Stevens](https://www.amazon.com/TCP-Illustrated-Vol-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633469)
    - [The Joy of Cryptography by Mike Rosulek](https://joyofcryptography.com/)
    - [Graph Theory by JA Bondy and USR Murty](https://www.amazon.com/Graph-Theory-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1849966907)
    - [The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
    - [Algebra by Serge Lang](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics-Serge/dp/038795385X)

**Long Term Goals**
- Technically a medium term goal, but "catch up" in cs (trying to cover the content of a 4+1 computer science degree in 1 year; my journey is documented [here](tmcs))
- Get accepted to a Computer Science or Statistics PhD [^1]
- Publish my own papers

[^1]: for a school that excels in a subfield I am interested in. Of course, I have a much better idea of Statistics rather than Computer Science. I need to figure out what *excels* means for me. 

## Finally, He's Actually Going to Log

Here are some of the things I've done this past week. 

### Papers
I've read two interesting papers: [The UNIX Time-Sharing System by Richie, Thompson](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/cs262/unix.pdf) and [Eraser by Anderson, Savage, Burrows, Nelson, and Sobalvarro](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~savage/papers/Tocs97.pdf). This is apart of a reading group I am doing with my friend for cs systems papers. One may ask, "Jonathan, didn't you just start studying computer science? What makes you think you have ANY knowledge about the field?" To the naysayers, I reply "Fuck you." I'm referencing a bunch of different reading groups as a starting point[^2] and also I believe any exposure (at least with respect to reading papers in a field) is helpful. If the papers are "too difficult" or "too easy", I can always adjust and finetune. 

This week I am reading 4 papers: [Resilient Overlay Networks by Anderson, Balakrishnan, Kaashoek, and Morris](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/ron-sosp2001.pdf), [DARPA Internet Protocols by Clark](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-clark.pdf), [Ethernet by Metcalfe and Boggs](https://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/EthernetPaper.pdf), and [Tor by Dingledine, Mathewson, and Syverson](https://svn-archive.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf).

[^2]: again, you can find these in the my cs journey blog [post](tmcs)

### Textbooks
Additionally, I've been working through [The Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com/), [Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X), and [Computer Architecture-A Quantitative Approach by John Hennessy and David Patterson](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Architecture-Quantitative-Approach-Kaufmann/dp/0128119055/ref=pd_lpo_sccl_1/142-9718449-3690637?pd_rd_w=WcuyK&content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_r=T45BBX6JHQ95B3ZSA428&pd_rd_wg=akLZP&pd_rd_r=2611a6b9-3525-466f-8552-6f5fe6acc060&pd_rd_i=0128119055&psc=1). Once I finish these, I think I will spend more time with cs theory and maybe some statistics. I have really been enjoying studying cs systems but we will see in a few months where my passions lie. 

### Personal
I finally started working out again after 2-3 months. It always sucks the first week or two back from a long break. On the cardio end, I have been running 1.5 miles daily consistently. My pace is GODDAMN awful right now (~9 minute mile) but we will improve. Also, I finally got this website working. It is really bare-bones at the moment but I finished setting up easy markdown-HTML conversion for the blog. Maybe for other sections, I will use the same conversion but I would prefer the customizability for other sections. For my website, my current stack is [Golang](https://go.dev/), [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/), and [templ](https://templ.guide/).

Also, I've been studying for an AWS certification. In my mind, certifications are a little (*just a skosh*) bullshit but I have been enjoying learning about some basics of cloud computing. 

Also, I've been working on my paper for UCSF. It's nearly done and hopefully I can finish up a few toy models for the paper by the end of this week. We will see next week!
